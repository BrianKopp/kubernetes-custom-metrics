# Custom Metrics Scaled Worker

This app does basically nothing except scale up and down based on
a custom metric served by the `examples/custom-external-emitter` app.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/briankopp/kubernetes-custom-metrics
cd examples/custom-metrics-scaled-worker
node index.js
```
